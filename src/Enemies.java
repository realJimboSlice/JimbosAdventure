Room 5 - Boss Room
	House of Satan - it’s deep, deep underground. Doesn't get any deeper than this.

Room 6(66) - Mini Boss Room
	A long and brittle stone bridge suspended over a fiery abyss, which perhaps houses a balrog - who knows? No one does.

Mini-boss:

Discount Gandalf - Encountered in Room 6(66)

	Description:
	“A dirty old hobo blocks your way. Cloaked in a black trash bag, tinfoil hat and waving a stick around.
	“You shall not pass! *burp* You got some cash or 		grass, bitch?”

	What will you do? Make a choice.
	1. If player has cash - give it to him.
	2. If player has some weed - give it to him.
	3. Flip the bird and move along.
	4. Whoop his motherfuckin’ ass.
	5. Draw a pentagram with your blood and summon Satan?

	1. You hand over the cash. Discount Gandalf looks displeased and demands some reefer too.
	2. You hand over the grass. Discount Gandalf with a sleight of hand, nimbly rolls a blunt and sparks it.
	He seems pleased and lets you *puff puff* pass.
	3. You flip the bird and shout “fuck you old man!”. Discount Gandalf becomes enraged and gains a 420% attack bonus.
	Damn, turns out he’s one of those rare Berserker Mages. Who would’ve guessed?
	4. He’s been steppin’ to you. He’s all up in your grill. You tried to warn him. Told him the law of the streets.
	Just because he lived a long life, it don’t mean that it can’t come to a short end.
	Alas, the ladies are lookin’ your way and you ain’t lookin’ too good. Your street cred’s in question, homie.
	Time to permanently retire his ass. Fo shizzle.
	5. (50% chance) You cut your palm and let the blood spill onto the ground.
	The pentagram you drew ended up resembling a pony thus nothing happens. What’d you expect?
	Also, you’re bleeding. That’s -25HP, fool! Better luck next time, kid.
	5.5. (50% chance) You slash your palm and let the blood spill onto the ground.
	A balrog answers your call. Discount Gandalf gets straight up roasted.
	The balrog turns to you and claims his payment. He siphons 99HP.
	Oof… I hope you drank a health potion… or else you’re probably dead. Tough shit.
